            <h1>What is Crafty?</h1>
            <p>
                Crafty is a community Discord bot made for your community. It has commands ranging from fun to moderation to utility commands.
                It also features a smart dashboard you can use to customize the bot to your needs. This way you can set-up what you want,
                and what your community needs.
            </p>

            <h1>When is the alpha?</h1>
            <p>
                May 1st to May 5th. The purpose of the alpha is for you test out Crafty and find bugs and errors, while also giving
                us feedback on the commands. Like the way to commands work for example. You can also suggest commands, or  
                suggest to remove commands. During the alpha, access to the moderation commands will still be locked. Those
                will be tested by a select group of alpha testers in a private  side server. You can sign up for this in the 
                server.
            </p>

            <h1>Why should I become a tester?</h1>
            <p>
                Because of the perks! For example, you will get 10 days early access to Crafty. This means you will be able to 
                add Crafty to your server before the rest of the world. If the bots has success, which depends on if it works
                or not, you can also receive payment in the later stages.
            </p>

            <h1>When will Crafty release?</h1>
            <p>
                June 10th. This is the planned global release date. This is after the alpha test, which are from May 1st to May 5th,
                and after the beta tests, which are June 1st to June 5th. After the beta tests, we need a few days to add the 
                feedback to the bot and fixing some errors. Then, on June 10th, we will release to all and you are free to add it, 
                in case you didn't already during the beta tests. After that, we will have a hotfix ready for issues that might
                rise.
